Preamble
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the source of the library TSODLULS (Tree Structured Orders Definition Language, Universal Lexicographic Sort).

This library provides functions to:
 - lexicographicalize keys for sorting,
 - parse TSODL (Tree Structured Orders Definition Language) and generate C code from a TSOD (Tree Structured Order Definition) to lexicographicalize the keys,
 - sort string using (Contre)Lexicographic or Next order.

To understand the theory behind this library you can read our article:
"A class of orders with linear? time sorting"
