If you want to understand this template, please look first at stdlib/qsort.c in glibc library
(the code below was partly copy-pasted from version 2.27 of glibc).
This template uses the following template variable:
  @iNumberOfElementsForInsertionSort@
It corresponds to the C constant MAX_THRESH in glibc.
